# Iron Browser  
*A modern, Swift-based macOS browser built with WebKit — inspired by the simplicity and workflow of the original Arc.*

## 🚀 Overview
Iron Browser is a macOS-native web browser written entirely in Swift using AppKit + WebKit.  
The goal: create a clean, fast, elegant browsing experience that continues where Arc left off before The Browser Company pivoted to AI.

This project focuses on:
- 🧭 Having a powerful sidebar-based tab system  
- ⚡ Being fast, lightweight performance using WebKit  
- 🎯 Clean macOS-native UI (AppKit > SwiftUI for stability)  
- 🧩 and extendable architecture for Spaces, Command Bar, and future features  

The project is in **early development** — starting with core structure:
- NSSplitViewController layout  
- Sidebar placeholder  
- WKWebView rendering engine  
- Basic project scaffolding  

More features will be added as the browser evolves.

## 🧠 Why This Project Exists
I loved Arc as a user and it was a very different experience compared to other browsers. (And my usual go-to was Opera for the longest time)
But when BCNY stopped all development and put Arc into maintainence mode to pivot towards Dia, I got a bit salty and went hunting for a similar browser.
Zen was cool, the customizable transparent UI was dope, but it's running Gecko and Gecko on macOS is not for me. SigmaOS just wasn't what I wanted. 
So...I started this.

Iron Browser aims to carry that torch forward, focused on:
- Productivity  
- Customization  
- Aesthetic simplicity  
- Mac-native experience
