## Why am I building this?

I got bored. Arc Browser went into maintanence mode, I got salty about it, so here I am

## Progress Expectation

Soon. Maybe you'll find out everytime I commit.

## Tech Stack

- *Xcode 26.1.1*
- *WebKit Engine via WKWebView*
- *Swift 6.2*

## End goal

I don't really expect this little project to work out but when it does, I hope you'll know it started from this little rusty idea.
